# Solutions for Advent of Code 2019 (sort of)

This repo contains (half of) my original solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) written in Rust. 

This is the actual code I used, so it is rather crappy, as the focus was mostly on getting the answer, not on writing decent code. Also, I implemented solutions for the second part of every day on top of solutions for the first part, which resulted in latter being mostly lost (hence “half of” above). Also also, I shouldn't probably create a separate project for every day (it resulted in a lot of copy-paste).

I took hints from reddit in 16.2 (didn't notice \[spoiler\] and tried to work with FFT, almost gone mad), 21.2 (overcomplicated things and got confused), and 22.2 (managed to understand most of the math, but didn't get that \[spoiler\]; calculated \[spoiler\] with a 3rd party crate). Solved (rather complicated) 18.1 and 18.2, but only on the next day.

At some point I considered to rewrite all this to make it pretty, but decided that I have better things to do, so publishing it as is.
