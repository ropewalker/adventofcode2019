# Solutions for Advent of Code 2019 (sort of)

This repo contains (half of) my original solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) written in Rust. 

This is the actual code I used, so it is pretty crappy, as the focus was mostly on getting the answer, not on writing a decent code. Also, I implemented solutions for the second part of every day on top of solutions for the first part, so latter are mostly lost (hence “half of” above). Also, I shouldn't probably create a separate project for every day (it resulted in a lot of copy-paste).

I considered to rewrite all this to make it pretty, but decided that I have better things to do, so publishing it as is.
